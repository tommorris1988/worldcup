=== Internal Linking For Scheduled Posts ===

Stable tag: 1.01

A very simple way to add scheduled posts to WordPress' internal linking system.

== Description ==

If you write posts scheduled for the future and want to link between them, this can help!  WordPress has a great, fast tool for linking to posts on your own site, but it only lists already-published posts.  Usually this makes sense, but if you do a lot of writing for the future via scheduled posts you may want to expand that.

== Installation ==

1. Use the WordPress.org plugin directory, or upload to your server's plugins directory.
2. After activating Jetpack by WordPress.com, you will be asked to connect to WordPress.com to enable the Jetpack features.
3. Enjoy!
